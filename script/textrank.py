Introduction Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) is a warm season annual grass crop and has been grown in Africa and Indian subcontinent since prehistoric times. Because of its tolerance to difficult growing conditions, it can be grown in areas where other cereal crops, such as maize or wheat, would not survive. Foxtail millet is a cereal crop and it has bundle of energy, protein, iron and zinc and lot of antioxidants (Gopalan et al., 2006, Nambiar et al., 2011). For nutritional purpose, 100 g of millet contains, 351 calories, 11.2 g of protein, 4 g of total fat, 63.2 g of carbohydrate. Millet is used to control tumor, blood pressure and and plasma–low-density protein, cholesterol levels and to control diabetes (Nambiar et al., 2012). Millet contains high amount of energy, protein and fat (Gopalan et al., 2006) iron, zinc and has high amount of antioxidants (Nambiar et al., 2011). These dietary nutrients are very useful for healthy and fit for life. It is also important to control diseases like tumor treatment, blood pressure, cholesterol level and diabetes in the body (Nambiar et al., 2012). Atrazine is used to control broadleaf and grassy weeds (Erinle et al. 2018). Tomer and Singh, 1973, Panchal and Sastry, 1974 reported that, atrazine used before weed emergence enhanced millet yield by 28% and 100%. Millet seedlings exposure to atrazine reduces germination, shoot and biomass production (Dan et al., 2010, Burhan and Shaukat, 2000) which is main reason for caused plant cell death (Singh et al., 2004). Atrazine herbicide is major cause of the reduction of photosynthesis, by reducing the photosystem II (Bai et al., 2015). The reduction of PSII electron transport inhibited the conversion of chlorophyll absorbed light energy into electro-chemical energy which ultimately produces triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen (Perez-Jones et al., 2009). The fast production of these reactive radicals, are called as the ROS, which ultimately effected APX, POD, CAT production in PSII, which ultimately destroyed proteins, lipids and pigments (Dan, 2000, Zhu et al., 2009). Mainly, physiological mechanisms such as photosynthesis process are reduced by damaging stomatal and non-stomatal openings (Rahnama et al., 2010). In this research, antioxidant enzymes for example SOD, POD, APX, MDA and ROS and their physiological mechanism were studied under different atrazine concentrations. The present study was designed to investigate the physiological and biochemical behavior of foxtail millet varieties to atrazine, and to estimate the optimize and suitable dose of atrazine for controlling pollution in foxtail millet. Materials and methods Experimental design Atrazine (10%, WP) was provided by Dengfeng Jinbo Pesticide Chemical Co., Ltd. The seeds Zhangza 10 (foxtail millet variety) were supplied by the Zhangjiakou Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The seeds of Jingu 21 were provided by Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Experimental study was conducted during 2019 at the farm of Shanxi Agricultural University, China. The experimental site has a temperate continental climate. The soil is loamy containing 20.08 g kg−1 organic matter, 37.33 mg kg−1 alkaline N, 24.3 mg kg−1 available P, and 90.01 mg kg−1 available K at 0–20 cm soil layer. The experiment consist of randomized complete block design with three replicates. After germination at three-leaf to five-leaf stage, the plants were treated with 0 control (CK), 2.5 (T1), 12.5 (T2), 22.5 (T3) and 32.5 (T4) mg/kg atrazine. The application was made with a laboratory pot-sprayer equipped with a nozzle, adjuster to deliver 450 L/ha. The data on agronomic characters, physiological parameters, and chlorophyll fluorescence of foxtail millet seedlings were recorded after 10 and 20 days. The yield and quality parameters were measured at maturity stage. Measurements Plant height The plant height, length and width of leaves were measured with meter rod. The Stem thickness measured with vernier caliper. After harvesting, measure the ear length, ear weight, ear thickness, ear grain weight and other indicators with a ruler, vernier caliper, and a ten-thousandth analytical balance (Mettler-Toledo, LLC. Shanghai, China). Physiological parameters Physiological parameters like photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs) and intercellular CO2 concentrations (Ci) were measured by CI-340 portable photosynthesis system (CID Bio-Science, Inc., USA) during day time 10:00 to 11:00 am. The maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), apparent electron transport rate (ETR) and photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) and non-photochemical quenching coefficient (qN) were measured by the miniaturized pulse-amplitude modulated fluorescence analyzer (Mini-PAM, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) from 8:30 to 10:00 pm (according to Guo et al., 2018), briefly described here. The Chlorophyll a content, Chlorophyll b content, Total Chlorophyll content and caroteniad contents were determined according to (Yuan et al., 2017). Enzymatic parameters MDA was determined by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test according to (Gao, 2006). The activity of APX was determined according to the method of (Yoshiyuk, 1981). Fresh foxtail millet leaf (0.1 g) was homogenized in 2 mL 0.5 mol/L phosphate buffer (PH 7.0), and centrifuged at 10000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The glutathione reductase (GR) activity was carried out according to (Halliwell et al., 1978). Fresh foxtail millet leaf (0.1 g) was weighed into an ice-cooled mortar, grinded in an ice bath with 2 mL 1 mol/L Tris-HCl (PH 7.5), and centrifuged at 13000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C according to method described by Guo et al., (2018). The (AsA/DHA) was determined according to Jiang (2001) briefly described here. Fresh leaf (0.1 g) was mixed in 2 mL of 5% chilled sulfosalicylic acid in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10,000 r min−1 for 15 min at 4 °C. This method determined the total ascorbic acid content and to measure the amount of AsA used to replace DTT and n-ethylmaleimide. Nagalakshmi (2001) method was used to estimate (GSH/GSSG) briefly described here. This is standardized method which is used to estimate GSSG and the total glutathione used in isopycnic distilled water to replace 2-vinylpyridine. Fresh foxtail millet leaf (0.1 g) was weighed into an ice-cooled mortar, grinded in an ice bath with 2 mL 5% chilled sulfosalicylic acid in an ice bath and centrifuged at 10 000 r min -1 for 15 min at 4 °C. A 200-μL aliquot of the supernatant was removed and neutralized by the addition of 24 μL 1.84 mol L-1 triethanolamine, 50 μL 2-vinylpyridine and 5% chilled sulfosalicylic acid for 60 min at 25 °C for GSSG reductase to mask GSH via derivatization and to allow for the determination of GSSG alone. The above reaction was mixed with 2.7 mL 0.05 mol L-1Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mmol L-1 EDTA), 20 μL 0.01 mmol L-1 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and 80 μL 12.5 mmol L-1 5,5́-dithiobis- (2-nitrobenzoic acid) DTNB for 10 min at 25 °C. A 20-μL aliquot of glutathione reductase (50 U mL−1) was added and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored for 3 min. This method was used to measure GSSG and the total glutathione used in isopycnic distilled water to replace 2-vinylpyridine. Statistical analysis For statistical analysis of the data Microsoft Office Excel 2010 and data processing system (DPS 7.05) were used. Duncan’s test was used to estimate significant differences among the treatments. We used P = 0.05 as the statistical significance threshold. Result Effects of atrazine on gas exchange parameters of foxtail millet Under atrazine stress, the plant height, leaf area and stem diameter of Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10 significantly decreased to varying degrees, and there was a certain dose effect (Table 1). Atrazine treatments from T1 to T4 significantly decreased the agronomic traits of foxtail millet seedlings after 10 and 20 days. After 10 days of atrazine application, the plant height, leaf area and stem thickness of Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10 were significantly decreased by 39.71%, 31.40%, 11.49%, 41.22%, 30.34%, 11.32%, respectively; while, decreased by 29.43%, 17.39%, 13.78%, 38.65%, 33.08%, 26.17% after 20 days. Therefore, at the initial stage of application, the recommended dose of atrazine had severe phytotoxicity to both Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10, but the phytotoxicity gradually ceased over time, and the relief capacity of Jingu 21 was slightly stronger than Zhangzagu 10.

After 7 days of recommended dose of atrazine treatment application, the Pn, Tr and Gs of Jingu 21 was decreased by 13.99%, 12.66% and 11.23% compared with control, but the Ci of Jingu 21 had no significant difference; the Tr and Gs of Zhangzagu 10 was decreased by 5.08% and 9.92, the Ci increased by 8.06%, but the Pn of Zhangzagu 10 had no significant difference with CK. After 15 days of herbicide treatment, the gas exchange parameters of foxtail millet seedlings showed varying degrees of recovery, the Pn and Tr of Jingu 21 gradually decreased to the control level, and the Pn and Ci of Zhangzagu 10 recovered to no significant difference from CK. Effects of atrazine on gas exchange parameters of foxtail millet seedlings. After high-dose atrazine treatment (T3, T4), the gas exchange parameters of foxtail millet seedlings had always significant difference compared with CK. The Pn, Tr and Gs of the millet leaves were the lowest and Ci was the highest after T4 treatment. After 7 and 15 days of treatment, the Pn, Tr and Gs of Jingu 21 was significantly decreased by 23.37%, 15.75%, 7.86% and 27.03%, 13.33%, 8.85%, Ci was significantly increased by 14.47% and 13.88%; the Pn, Tr and Gs of Zhangzagu 10 was significantly decreased by 43.34%, 23.20%, 15.94% and 22.40%, 28.90%, 13.32%, Ci was significantly increased by 12.32% and 10.25%, separately. According to our results, the effect of atrazine herbicide on the gas exchange parameters of Zhangzagu 10 was higher than that of Jingu 21 and fertility process was not affected. Effects of atrazine on chlorophyll fluorescence of foxtail millet As shown in Table 3, with the increase of the dosage of atrazien, the Fv/Fm, ETR and qP of Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10 showed a decreasing trend, while qN showed an increasing trend. After 10 days of exposure to atrazine, the Fv/Fm, ETR and qP of Jingu 21 significantly decreased compared with control, while qN was significantly increased than that of CK. After exposing the seedlings to T2 for 20 days, the Fv/Fm and qP recover to the control level, ETR significantly decreased by 11.26%, qN significantly increased by 10.85%. The chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics of Jingu 21 were still significantly different from CK after T3 and T4 treatment. The ETR of Zhangzagu 10 was significantly reduced by 9.33% and 11.23%, while qN significantly increased by 13.52% and 10.00% compared with control.

Apart from the T1 treatment, the MDA content of foxtail millet in all other treatments was significantly increased compared with control after 7 days. Afte 15 days of exposure to atrazine, the MDA content of Jingu 21 was recovered to the control level, but it was significantly increased by 25.30% and 26.70% at T3 and T4 treatment; the content of MDA in Zhangzagu 10 had no significant difference as compared with control when treated with T2 and T3, but it significantly increased by 27.70% compared with control at the T4 dose. Effects of atrazine on MDA contents and SOD、POD、CAT、APX、GR activities of foxtail millet. As shown in Fig. 2B, with the increase of atrazine concentration, the activity of SOD increased and subsequently decreased. The maximum expression levels of SOD activity obtained after treatment with T2 and T3 for 7 days, and the SOD activity of Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10 was significantly increased by 12.17% and 10.11%. After 15 days atrazine treatment, the SOD activity of foxtail millet showed various degrees of relief in each treatment, but they were still significantly higher than control treatment in T2, T3 and T4 treatments. With the increase of the dosage of atrazine, the POD activity of Jingu 21 increased, and Zhangzagu 10 increased and subsequently decreased (Fig. 2-C). Apart from the T1 treatment, the POD activity of foxtail millet in all other treatments was significantly increased compared with control after 7 days. After 15 days of exposure to atrazine, the POD activity of Jingu 21 was recover to the control level at the T2 and T3 dose compared with CK, but that in Zhangzagu 10 was significantly increased by 15.01% and 16.27%, respectively; the POD activity of Jingu 21 was significantly increased by 19.33% compared with control at the T4 dose, but there is no significant difference as compared to control in Zhangzagu 10. Under atrazine stress, the CAT activity of Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10 all decreased to varying degrees (Fig. 2-D). Apart from the T1 treatment, the CAT activity of Jingu 21 in all other treatments was significantly increased by 29.11%, 40.03%, 48.03% and 17.88%, 18.63%, 35.77%, compared with control after 7 and 15 days. The CAT activity of Zhangzagu 10 was highest in T4 treatment after 7 days and T3 treatment after 15 days, which were significantly increased by 33.45% and 24.66% compared with control treatment, respectively. With the increase of atrazine concentration, the activity of APX increased and subsequently decreased, APX activity reached the highest during T3 treatment (Fig. 2-E). Compared with control, atrazine treatment at the recommended dose increased the APX activity by 22.43% and 28.20% for Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10 after 7 days of treatment application, and after 15 days of herbicide application, it recovered to the control level. Under the T3 and T4 atrazine treatment, the APX activity of the foxtail millet is always significantly higher than that of CK, and there was no obvious relief with the progress of the fertility process. With the increase of the dosage of atrazine, the GR activity of Jingu 21 increased and subsequently decreased, and Zhangzagu 10 increased (Fig. 2-F). After 7 days of application, the GR activity of the foxtail millet was significantly higher than that of control when treated with T2, T3 and T4; after 15 days of the application, the GR activity of Jingu 21 was still significantly higher than that of control while Zhangzagu 10 recovered to the control level under T2 and T3 treatment, and was significantly increased by 10.13% compared with CK under T4 treatment. Effects of atrazine on antioxidant content of foxtail millet Different dosages of atrazine have different effects on AsA, DHA, Total AsA content and AsA/DHA ratio of foxtail millet leaves (Table 4). The content of AsA, DHA and total AsA increased with the increase in atrazine dosage. After exposing the seedlings to the recommended dose of atrazine, the AsA, total AsA content and AsA/DHA ratio of Jingu 21 was significantly increased by 41.11%, 18.03% and 63.31%, respectively; after 20 days, AsA content recovered to the control level, while total AsA content and AsA/DHA ratio were still significantly higher than CK. The content of AsA, DHA and total AsA of Zhangzagu 10 were significantly higher than those of control treatment after 10 and 20 days of application, the content of AsA, DHA and total AsA has no obvious relief, the DHA content was not significantly different from that of control treatment when compared with with T1, T2 and T3.

The reason of this is that highest atrazine dose at (50 mg/kg) droped chlorophyll content because chl is known as a sensitive indicator for plant growth (Wei et al., 2011). The main reason of this is also the destruction effect of atrazine on chlorophyll pigment. Decrease in chlorophyll content is due to very high chlorophyll depletion instead of its slow release. Main discovery of our study is that chl (a/b) ratio enhanced due to atrazine stress. Chloroplasts are major site of protein degradation, which is initiated by ROS (Khanna-Chopra 2012) and 75% cellular nitrogen is located in mesophyll cells (H€ortensteiner and Feller 2002). Different reports demonstrated that excessive application of post-emergent herbicides like fluroxypyr inhibited plant growth (Guo et al., 2018; 2019). In this experiment, we recorded that atrazine had less effect on plant growth at low doses, but have bad effect due high doses. The growth inhibition of atrazine is similar to the accumulation of O2− and H2O2 in plants (Guo et al., 2010). Our results are supported by (Guo et al., 2019, Sun et al., 2019) that as post-emergence herbicide like fluroxypyr and Bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) reduced growth parameters so as atrazine concentrations increased the growth parameters also decreased in our study (Ning et al., 2015). Chlorophyll pigments in plants absorb light energy that is used for producing photosynthates. For example, chlorophyll content is the main source of light energy for photosynthesis. Increased doses of atrazine in foxtaill millet significantly reduced the photosynthetic content of the leaves (Su et al., 2016, Guo et al., 2005). Increased atrazine doses reduced growth parameters such as plant height and biomass, which reduced stomatal conductance, respiration, and reduced photosynthesis. Our findings proved that as atrazine doses increased there was significant decrease were recorded in Fv/Fm, FPSII, Fo, Fv/Fm, qP, and ETR in foxtail millet (Wu and Bao, 2011, Guo et al., 2019). PSII and ETR reduction at atrzine treatment increase was due to a reduction of the efficiency of excitation energy capture of PSII reaction centers (Wu and Bao, 2011). The reduction of qP as atrazine doses increase was due to that atrazine harmed PSII reaction centers and increased the proportion of closed PSII reaction centers, probably cause a decrease in the proportion of available excitation energy used for photochemistry (Bigot et al., 2007). Our findings are supported by Yuan et al., 2013; 2017, who reported that sigma broad in Radix Isatidis seedlings and foxtail millet. Atrazine is photosynthetic inhibitor as it stop the electron-acceptor protein PSII by reducing electron transfer in the photosynthetic process. This reduction of electron stop the chlorophyll-absorbed light energy into electro-chemical energy, which is main cause of reduction of chlorophylls and oxygens (Perez et al., 2009, Erinle et al., 2016). The high production of these ROS reduces synthesis of proteins, lipids and pigments (Erinle et al., 2016). The main reason of this is that herbicide application to plants may be destroy antioxidant defense system. Same resutls are reported in wheat that overproduction of ROS is due to herbicide application (Jiang and Yang 2009) and in rice seedlings by over accumulation of atrazine in rice shoot (Zhang et al., (2014). Atrazine effect on foxtail millet leaves for enzymes produces free radicals, that will damage the cells. ROS (free redicals) are damaged by activation of antioxidant enzymes. One enzyme SOD catalyzes the molecules of superoxide into H2O2 and O2. In this study, effect of atrazine (50 mg/kg) on SOD performance in foxtail millet seedlings enhanced and then reduced, the main reason of this is damage of defense system in the leaves. Moreover, POD enzyme is also used in the split of H2O2 (Wang and Zhou 2006). This will increase POD activity in the foxtail millet to atrazine and POD and CAT are enzymes breakdown H2O2 into water (Yin et al. 2008) in plants. CAT/POD enzymes also work together to remove H2O2 at high level with less power use (Siddiqui et al., 2011, Xu et al., 2013). The CAT/POD enzymes protect the photosynthesis against oxidative stress (Liang et al., 2009). Moreover CAT enzymes reduced in foxtail millet as atrazine concentration increased. This is reduction in CAT activity is by increasing H2O2 that reduces the enzyme activity (Song et al., 2007). Activation of POD and CAT enymes increases defense system of plant to protect the oxidative stress caused by atrazine (Mi et al., 2014, Qiu et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2011). Conclusion According to our results, as atrazine application increased growth parameters like plant height and biomass decreased which reduced chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The overall photosynthetic performance index, PI, and Fv/Fm in our study were considered very sensitive indicator in response to photosynthetic performance of foxtail millet varieties. Our present findings showed that increased atrzine concentrations reduced the photosynthetic performance in foxtail millet varieties. Fianlly, according to our results high doses of atrazine badly effected physiological process of foxtail millet. High doses of atrazine promoted the photosynthesis process by whic activities of the antioxidant enzymes were reduced, in order to protect ROS production. It is very important that find suitable atrazine concentrations which is safe for physiological damages to the plant. We recommended that T2 and T3 treatments of atrazine are safe for foxtaill millet cultivation and among cultivars zhangzagu 10 performed better.
