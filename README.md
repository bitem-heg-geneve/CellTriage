# CellTriage
The project aims at using state-of-the-art machine learning methods, and in particular transformers, to develop a dedicated triage service to help Cellosaurus curators to navigate the literature. The projectâ€™s main goal is improving scalability of Cellosaurus curation to gain efficiency and comprehensiveness.
